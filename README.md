# CuisineQuest - Every Meal is a Journey

CuisineQuest is a recipe browser made using React, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) API

## How to run

I **have not** included the **index.scss** file because it is to large as it includes all of Tailwinds styles.

use:

`touch src/styles/index.scss`

to create an index.scss file that the `npm build:css` script can compile to.

You will need an api key stored in a .env file from the spoonacular api to run it.

Current progress: Final version
